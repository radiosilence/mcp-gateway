 * a 502 waiting to happen, and the in-cluster URL joining them is derived, not
 * written down.
 *
 * `credentialHeader` is the shorthand for the common one-token case;
 * `fields` covers backends wanting several values (CalDAV needs a username, an
 * app password, and a server URL); `public` covers a backend fronting something
 * public, which needs neither. Exactly one of the three, matching what the
 * gateway's registry accepts.
 *
 * `public` is opt-in rather than inferred from an absent credential block: a
 * backend declaring no credentials is far more often a typo than a decision,
 * and the deploy should fail rather than quietly front an unauthenticated MCP.
